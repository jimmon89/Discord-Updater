# Discord-Updater
A script i made for myself to quickly update the .tar.gz release of discord and then patch it with vencord
## Usage
### (if you're batshit insane...)
### run:
```
sh -c "$(curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimmon89/Discord-Updater/main/Discord-Updater-Ma-Doo-Hicky-Kabob.sh)"
```

### (If you want to have any idea what the actual fuck is going on...)
```
Don't just run random scripts off of the internet!
Especially don't pipe them straight from curl or anything like it into the shell!!!!
Download them...
Read them...
Look for anything sketchy, or out of the ordinary...
Try to understand what each line of the script is doing!
Only when you're sure it's safe do you actually run it!


Don't trust my coding, i barely know what i'm doing!
Imagine the damage someone with malicious intent could do...
I mean, it works great on my machine...
However i offer no warranty, explicit nor implied...
I'm not responsible for you're machine, that's your job!
Beyond this?
Travelers beware!
Here be dragons!
